# First Release

This is the first release of this CLI tool. It contains all the basic functionalities such as:
- Parsing individual items
- Parsing basic types
- Adding types as values to give an indication what is needed

What it doesn't contain yet is checking for valid values, such as, nullable or regex defined entries.
