# Fix a bunch of issues

- Have option to print output to stdout, rather than writing to a file [#21](https://github.com/Skarlso/crd-to-sample-yaml/issues/21)
- Update generate -c to receive a url to some yaml [#20](https://github.com/Skarlso/crd-to-sample-yaml/issues/20)
- descriptions would be nice [#16](https://github.com/Skarlso/crd-to-sample-yaml/issues/16)
